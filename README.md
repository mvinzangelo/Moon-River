## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was the Rose Hack logo! We really liked the aesthetic of the logo when we initially signed up for the event, so what we wanted to do was make a story based around that picture. 

## How we built it
We built this game using Unity, C# scripts, and we were able to collaborate virtually through a GitHub repo.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge for us as a group was figuring out how to use GitHub. We have never used GitHub to collaborate on a project before, so for the first few hours, we had to learn how to use branches, push our changes, and how to link it up with our Unity project file. We also have very limited experience in C# as well; the only other language that we were familiar with before today was C++. Although all of us have never done any form of object oriented programming and we had to learn as we went, we used the fundamental skills that we have in order to teach ourselves the basics. 

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We were very proud of the narrative that we drafted in a very short amount of time; we believe that the short story is the best part of our game. We treated our project not much like a game, but like a short interactive storybook. Also, most of the assets used in the game were made by us, and we are very satisfied with the aesthetic of the game. 

## What we learned
We learned how to better collaborate as a team, both as people and through learning how to use GitHub. We were also able to get exposed to object oriented programming in C# and Unity.

## What's next for Moon River
Since we enjoyed the short narrative that we crafted for this game, the next step for this game is to expand on the story, and we also want to continue using the minimalist art style that we used with the assets we made.
